# Kalana Sachinthana | Developer Portfolio 🚀

**Live Demo:** [[Insert Vercel Deployment Link Here](https://portfolio-react-with-tailwind-css-two.vercel.app/)]

## 🌟 Overview

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. Built with a focus on modern development standards, performance, and accessibility, the site features a clean, responsive layout and seamless user experience.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Flawlessly adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Includes a fully functional Dark Mode toggle for enhanced viewing comfort.
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses AOS (Animate On Scroll) for elegant, performance-friendly section transitions.
- **Modular Architecture**: Structured using React components and TypeScript for scalability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built using a modern frontend stack:

| Category | Technology | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Framework | React with Vite | Fast development server and optimized build process. |
| Language | TypeScript | Enhances code quality and catches errors early with static typing. |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling. |
| Deployment | Vercel | Continuous deployment and hosting with a custom domain. |
| Animation | AOS (Animate On Scroll) | Library for stunning, scroll-triggered visual effects. |

## 📂 Project Structure

The codebase follows a clear component-driven structure:

```

│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components (Header, Footer, Hero, ProjectCard, etc.)
│   ├── context/            # ThemeContext for global state management (Dark Mode)
│   ├── data/               # TypeScript data files (projectsData.ts, skillsData.ts)
│   ├── App.tsx             # Main application component
│   └── main.tsx            # Entry point for the React application
├── tailwind.config.js      # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
